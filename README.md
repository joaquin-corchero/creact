# Creact

**Framewokrs and tools:**
- AspNet Core 1.1
- React
- Babel
- Webpack
- Karma
- Enzyme
- Bootstrap
- Yahoo Weather api
- Entity Framework core (Lite and in memory for tests)

## Running instructions:
- Download and install the latest version of the [.net framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
- Clone the repo.
- Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (created with 6.11.1)
- If you are using VS2015 or VS2017 and you open the solution, on build the packages should get downloaded.
- If you prefer go to the console and follow this steps:
    - dotnet restore (restore nuget packages)
    - dotnet build (builds the application)
    - cd Creact    
    - npm run build (transpiles the React files and minifies css)
    - cd ../Creact.Tests
    - dotnet test (will run the tests)

On the Creact directory there are tests for the client app. You can run them by:
1. npm run test (single execution)
2. npm run test-watch (they will keep running)


On the same directory there are tasks to keep webpack watching and building your changes
1. npm run build-watch


Once the dotnet app is running there are two **endpoints**:
1. http://localhost:5000/api/contacts (post) to insert contacts
2. http://localhost:5000/api/contacts to see all the existing ones on the db.

### What is not there:
- There is no design patterns on the server side, the app is to simple for that, there are no service, no repos, nothing, if you are looking for complexity it won't be on the server side.
- I hope in the future add linting and hot reloading

### What I enjoyed:
It was nice but quite frustrating sometimes to work from scratch with both React and .net Core, sometimes for not having the tooling setup at home, sometimes because unit testing React, for me, has proven not to be always easy.

First time using in memory databases with EF core, quite nice for testing even though you unit tests become automatically integration tests...

Had to do different versions of the app as sometimes got sidetracked onto fights with different package versions or different packages all together...

It has been very rewarding to get the app to this stage, but is not finished...

### What should come up next:
- Lint
- Increase the size of the app (react router?)
- Addition of Redux/Relay-GraphQl ...?
- Change test framework to jest
